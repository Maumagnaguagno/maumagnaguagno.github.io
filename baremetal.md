# Bare metal
In programming a common practice is to avoid repetition and complexity by encapsulating instructions into routines.
Collections of such routines become the libraries that make certain programming languages better suited to tackle specific problems.
For microcontroller programming a well know environment is the Arduino, which abstracts away most of the initial and time-consuming setup step.
However, such easy-to-use interface costs a lot on the long run, with routines that are slower than what they could be and a lack of understanding on how things work.
Without a complete understanding of what is happening under the hood more people can handle and drive cars, but few can actually optimize their car for a specific need.
In the following sections the old blocks of microcontroller programming are explained.

## Selecting a microcontroller
Instead of searching for a single better microcontroller one must select which features are important first.
Such features may include:
- Amount of General Purpose Input/Output pins
- Amount of analog and digital pins
- Voltage and tolerance
- Physical size
- Protocols
- Instruction set
- Memory size
- Speed

## Digital Write
