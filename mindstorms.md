# Mindstorms
Based on constructionism from [Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert), MIT Media lab and the Lego group collaborated to push Lego to the digital world.
Lego was losing market space against the virtual worlds from the video-game industry and educational robotics looked like a good fit for the Lego parts, letting kids explore the real world through robots built with their own hands.
Gears, motors and many parts were already available from technic kits, but sensors and a programmable brick were missing to achieve a robotics kit.
The kits were named as Lego Mindstorms due to the book [Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindstorms:_Children,_Computers,_and_Powerful_Ideas) by Seymour Papert.

## RCX
The first fully programmable brick came to the market in 1998, after a long relationshop between MIT Media Lab and the Lego company.

### Scout, MicroScout and VLL
The RCX is a great introductory robotics kit, but due to cost and programming requirements (which require a computer not at hand for many kids) the RCX is simply too much.
A simpler solution came in the Scout, MicroScout and Spybotics sets.
The idea is simple: have less electronic parts (merge controller, sensors, motors, battery into a single element) and a few behaviors preprogrammed to explore.
The Scout (TODO add part here) is very similar to RCX, with less input and output ports (2 for each instead of 3) while using the same wires, motors and sensors from RCX, with a light sensor attached to the controller.
The MicroScout (TODO add part link) and Spybotics (TODO add part link) took the other path: a single electronic element for everything.

Such sets are easier to setup and play with the multiple behaviors programmed, but the Lego group noticed that some users would like go beyond after some time.
After the user explored the numbered programs within the system, it is time to explore the ``P`` program.

## NXT
The next generation of Mindstorms came in two versions, the first in July 2006 and the second one in August 2009.

## EV3
The evolution of Mindstorms created the third (and current) release of Lego robots in September 2013.
This time previous sensors and motors are supported due to no modifications to the cables, being the same from NXT.
